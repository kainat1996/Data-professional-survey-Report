### Transform the data
This is raw data and needed to be transformed first, and for this I took some steps 
for cleaning the data are as follows:
* At first I have removed the unwanted columns (blanked columns).
* Reduced options from (which title suites the best) using split option.
* I repeated the process for (what industry do you work in , and (which is your 
fav programming language).
* I created duplicate column for the salary and trimmed the salary parts.
* I created a column with name average salary from custom column option 
and then created AVG salary by adding the 2 column and dividing with 2.
* I deleted the duplicate columns and moved AVG column next to the salary 
column.
